Profanity Analyzer
This is a very brief bot made to analyze profanity encountered in subreddit r/TheDonald. After running the program, it will prompt the user to choose to continue or quit by pressing 1 or 2. It scans the document for some of the most common swear words that it's able to detect(the code is far from perfect but is effective enough to detect significant figures). While the code itself needed to contain uncensored swear words, a courtesy of censorship when displaying figures is in place.
